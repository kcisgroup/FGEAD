# Explainable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection by Feature Graph Structure Learning

```diff
The programming language used is Python 3.10 with Pytorch 2.0.1, CUDA 11.7, and PyTorch Geometric Library 1.5.0.
```



## How to run the code?

After downloading the code, you can run

```powershell
python3 main_run.py
```

directly for categorical clustering.  We suggest adjusting the hyperparameters multiple times to achieve better results.



## What are the scripts used for?

(1)[make_dataset](https://github.com/kcisgroup/Categorical-BERT/tree/main/make_dataset): Data processing. Help us prepare the training set.

(2)[my_models](https://github.com/kcisgroup/Categorical-BERT/tree/main/my_models): Define the network structure of FGEAD.

(3) [utils](https://github.com/kcisgroup/Categorical-BERT/tree/main/utils): Contains functions for data processing and model evaluation.





## Several toolkits may be needed to run the code

(1) pytorch (https://anaconda.org/pytorch/pytorch)

(2) sklearn (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scikit-learn)

(3) transformers (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/transformers)
